# What this page is
This page outlines my approach to DGE analysis (DESeq2) in a way that **non-specialists** can follow while still being methodologically correct. >s a living document; >ll add runnable code and results next.IIt

## TL;DR
- Goal: Compare two conditions to find genes with statistically reliable expression changes.
- Method (planned): DESeq2 negative binomial model with FDR control; LFC shrinkage for interpretability.
- Outputs (coming soon): PCA (QC), MA plot, volcano plot, top-table with FDR, brief biological interpretation.

## Audience-friendly summary
We measure how much each geneacross samples. After normalizing for technical effects, we test whether the difference between conditions is larger than >d expect by chance. We then control the **false discovery rate (FDR)** so our listgenes is reliable. changedof we onis 

## Planned workflow (high level)
1. **QC & normalization** (library size, variance-stabilizing transform)
2. **Modeling** with design formula (e.g., `~ batch + condition`)
3. **Multiple testing correction** (Hochberg FDR)Benjamini
4. **Effect size shrinkage** (apeglm) for clearer log2 fold changes
5. **Visualization**: PCA, MA plot, volcano, heatmap of top genes
6. **Reporting**: concise table + short interpretation

## Why these choices (brief)
- **DESeq2** handles count data with a negative binomial model.
- **FDR** keeps expected false positives manageable across thousands of genes.
- **Shrinkage** improves effect-size estimates for low counts.

## Next steps
- Add a small public dataset (Bioconductor *airway*).
- Add runnable code blocks and figures.
- Save results to `outputs/` and link them here.
